He had the perfect ideas in form of springlock suits, however, they lacked an entertainment factor, due to them being simple suits that had to be controlled by humans. It was only when he met his future business partner Henry Emily, whom he would find success with and where he would also get into robotics.<br><br>\nOn one day, his older son decided to pull a prank on his younger brother, by putting him into the mouth of one of the newly built animatronics, crushing his skull and ultimately killing him in the process. William was furios and fell into a depression. Not too long after, William's daughter Elizabeth was killed by one of his Animatronics, which was malfunctioning at the time. As people around him started to worry more and more about his mental health, and when his business partner Henry stopped cooperating, that was where he decided that enough was enough.<br><br>\nOne of his victims was Henry's daughter, which was killed in the backalley of one of the most famous Restaurants owned by him. Then another. Another. Another. Another. And another. Six children fell to his weapon. He hid the bodies inside the animatronics, but they were out for revenge. To some unknown reasons, William started destroying each animatronic one by one, eventually setting the souls free off their physical appearance.<br><br>\nIt was a rainy day, but little did he know, that it was about to get much worse for him. The souls of his victims stared chasing him. As he seeked shelter in an old bunny springlock suit, it malfunctioned, causing the mettalic parts inside the suit to rellentlessly push against his body, until it was completely crushed. With his flesh molten to the animatronic parts, he laid there, as a decaying corpse. Gone was the once beloved father, husband and genius robotic engineer, born was SPRINGTRAP.<br><br>\nAs it came to the companies attention, they sealed off the entire room, never to be found again. Or so they thought. As the rumors started to come to the public's attention, Fazbear Entertainment ultimately closed.<br><br>\nA group of entrepreneurs decided to buy the abandoned building and turn it into a horror attraction, but something was off. According to the building plans they were missing a room, and so they smashed the wall open, revealing the remains of William Afton. With Springtrap set free, he roamed the building, passing by old arcade machines and endoskeleton skulls he once built.<br><br>\nHis son, Michael Afton, was fully aware of his fathers demise. He knew everything he did and what happened to him and he was about to end it. As he stood in front of the main entrance of the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria, took a deep breath and burned the place to the ground. Pain, suffering and agony was about to get worse for William as the metal molted more and more with his flesh. Springtrap survived. The Enitity was impressed by Springtrap's survival skills. All the agony, hatred, pain and vengence was just wainting to be released. The last thing William saw was a dark fog emerging from the shadows.","power":{"name":"agonized agression ","description":"When the Entertainer is in the trial, _Audio Lures_ will randomly spawn across the map.
